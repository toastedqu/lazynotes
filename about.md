# About
I aim to build (or faciliate the progress towards) Artificial Consciousness (AC).

I believe modern ML/DL is nothing but data compression. It succeeds ONLY because big data exists.

"But.. but evolution provided massive training data which shaped our genomes over time, so we are born with strong built-in priors, just like foundational models!"

You know the last part is cap. You know the direction of the AI industry is fundamentally flawed.
