# Philosophy
Define consciousness.

You can't. There's no consensus on the definition of consciousness.

I find {cite:t}`blackmore2017consciousness`'s approach comprehensive:
- **Inner POV**: If you can say "What it's like to be ..." about something, that thing is conscious. Else, no.
- **Subjectivity / Phenomenality**: How things are experienced by a conscious being ≠ How they are described objectively / experienced by other conscious being.
- **Qualia**: The ineffable, personal, **qualitative** "feel" of experiences.
- **The hard problem**: How TF can subjective experience emerge from physical processes in the brain???

This page is my interpretation of {cite:t}`zelazo2007cambridge` and {cite:t}`blackmore2017consciousness`.

## Mysterianism
- **What**: Consciousness is a true mystery which will never be solved.
- **Why**: Has anyone solved it?
    - **Ontological mysterianism**: Consciousness is an inherently mysterious phenomenon.
    - **Epistemological mysterianism**: No, but humans don't have the cognitive abilities to solve it.
- **How** (McGinn's Epistemological mysterianism):
    - Prerequisites:
        - **Introspection**: Inner access to subjective experiences.
        - **Extrospection**: Outer access to the world via senses.
    - Main argument:
        1. We can introspect consciousness BUT NOT brain.
        2. We can extrospect brain BUT NOT consciousness.
        3. There's NO method for both introspection & extrospection.
        4. There's NO method to access both consciousness & brain.
- **Cap?**
    1. McGinn assumes **dualism** (mind & brain are 2 separate entities), but what if it's cap?
        - McGinn: Brain states $\xrightarrow{\text{cause}}$ Conscious states.
        - **Identity theory**: Brain states = Conscious states.
    2. McGinn believes in **cognitive closure** (we are mentally incapable of understanding consciousness), but what if it's cap?
        - McGinn: Rats can't understand trigonometry.
        - → BUT rats don't even know trig problems exist.
        - → **REAL cognitive closure**: The problem doesn't even properly pose itself to you.
        - → BUT the problem of consciousness DOES pose itself to us.
        - → Cap.

## Dualism
- **What**: Mind ≠ Body.
- **Why**: Facts about conscious experience cannot be fully captured by facts about the physical brain (YET).
- **How**:
    - **Substance dualism**:
        - **Substance**: Something that can exist all by itself.
        - Descarte's two substances:
            - **Extended substance** = body.
            - **Thinking substance** = mind.
            - Human = body + mind.
            - Body can exist without mind. Mind can exist without body.
    - **Property dualism**:
        - **Property**: A feature of something.
        - There's only 1 kind of stuff BUT 2 kinds of properties - **physical** & **mental**.
        - Mental properties CANNOT be fully reduced to physical properties.
            - Reducible: Completely explain one thing in terms of another.
    - **Cautious property dualism**:
        - Many mental properties ARE actually reducible: e.g., memory, attention, decision-making, language, ...
        - BUT **phenomenal properties** (i.e., "what it's like") are NOT reducible.
- **Cap?**
    - Diehard scientism: "Science explains everything else physically, why is consciousness any different?"
    - **Identity theory**: Brain states = Conscious states.
    - See the next section for more details.

### Naturalistic dualism
- **What**: Phenomenal properties are **causally** grounded in physical properties.
    - Other dualists: "Mind isn't physical."
    - Chalmers: "Yea right, BUT we can still study consciousness scientifically & tie it to physics."
- **Why**: Chalmers just didn't believe consciousness emerged out of pure randomness.
- **How**:
    1. Acknowledge dualism:
        - Phenomenal properties ≠ Physical properties.
        - NO supervenience for consciousness.
            - **Supervenience**: If A supervenes on B, once we fix all B-facts, all A-facts are auto fixed.
            - → e.g., If two humans are physically identical, they MUST be biologically identical.
            - → NOT for consciousness:
                - From purely physical facts, we cannot deduce consciousness as a matter of logic.
                - There’s a logically possible world with all the same physical facts BUT no experience (i.e., a zombie world), due to the difference in psychophysical laws.
    2. Deny random emergence:
        - Explanation of consciousness is **causal, NOT reductive**.
            - Reductive: "Consciousness is **JUST** brain process X."
            - Causal: "Brain process X **brings about** experience Y according to law Z."
        - → A complete theory of consciousness would include:
            - A set of physical laws.
            - A set of psychophysical laws (how physical configs cause experiences).
        - → "What are these laws?" "IDK, but I will give 2 guidelines."
            - **Structural coherence**: Structure of experience mirrors structure of info processing.
            - **Organizational invariance**: In our world, if we copy the functional organization, we copy the consciousness.
- **Cap?**
    - **Epiphenomenalism**: Conscious experiences are **REAL**, but they **DON'T CAUSE ANYTHING** in the physical world?
        - Charles assumes the physical world is causally closed → Every physical event has a **complete** physical cause.
        - → BUT that's cap. Our conscious thoughts & feelings DO make a difference IRL.
        - → If consciousness floats above physics, it's hard to see how it can really do anything without rejecting the idea that "physics is complete".

```{attention} Q&A
:class: dropdown
*"No supervenience for consciousness" contradicts "organizational invariance", no?*
- No. Let
    - $P$ = All physical laws.
    - $L$ = All psychophysical laws.
    - $C$ = All consciousness facts.
- No supervenience for consciousness: $P\Rightarrow C$ is cap, due to the difference in $L$.
- Organizational invariance: $P+L\Rightarrow C$ is real.
