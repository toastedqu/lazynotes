# Theories
This page is my interpretation of computational theories of consciousness from {cite:t}`ding2023survey`.

## Information Integration Theory (IIT)
- **What**: Consciousness = System's intrinsic cause-effect power to integrate information, quantified by how irreducible its integrated cause-effect structure is across all its subsystems.
    - *Ok wtf does that mean?*
    - 
- **Why**:
- **How**: 

## Consciousness as a State of Matter

## Orchestrated Objective Reduction Theory (Orch OR)

## Global Workspace Theory (GWT)

## High-Order Theory (HOT)

## Attention Schema Theory (AST)

## Consciousness Turing Machine (CTM)
