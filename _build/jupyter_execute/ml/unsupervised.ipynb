    "# Clustering\n",
    "Clustering groups similar samples together based on certain characteristics in order to find the hidden patterns within data to simplify and improve processing and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## K-means\n",
    "- **What**: Iteratively group samples into $k$ clusters till the centroids stabilize\n",
    "- **Why**: Find natural groupings within data.\n",
    "- **How**:\n",
    "    1. Initialize $k$ centroids.\n",
    "    2. Repeat:\n",
    "    \t1. Assign each sample to its nearest centroid.\n",
    "\t\t2. Update the centroids based on the mean of all samples assigned to them.\n",
    "    3. Break if required or until the centroids stabilize.\n",
    "- **When**:\n",
    "\t- There are exactly $k$ clusters in the data.\n",
    "\t- The data is scale-independent.\n",
    "\t- The clusters are spherical, equally sized, and well-separated with hard margins.\n",
    "- **Pros**:\n",
    "    - Simple.\n",
    "- **Cons**:\n",
    "    - Requires prior knowledge of $k$.\n",
    "\t- Sensitive to centroid initialization.\n",
    "\t- Bad performance on non-spherical, overlapping, or varying-sized clusters.\n",
    "\t- Possible convergence to local minima.\n",
