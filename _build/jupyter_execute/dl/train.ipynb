    "## Weight Initialization\n",
    "In any neural network, all parameters need to be initialized to be updated during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of initialization methods matters.\n",
    "- If the initial weights are too large / too small, exploding / vanishing gradients will take place.\n",
    "- If the weights are initialized improperly, convergence can be slow, nonexistent, or stuck in suboptimal solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Zero Initialization\n",
    "- **What**: All parameters are 0.\n",
    "- **Why**: Back in the days, people thought it was simple and unbiased due to a lack of understanding of deep learning.\n",
    "- **Pros**: Simple, unbiased, good performance with small models.\n",
    "- **Cons**:\n",
    "    - **Failure to break symmetry**: All weights produce the same output and receive the same gradients $\\rightarrow$ No learning.\n",
    "\t- Vanishing gradients.\n",
    "\t- No non-linearity.\n",
    "\t- Dead neurons if activated by the ReLU family.\n",
